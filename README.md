# 48-Week Comprehensive Programming Study Syllabus

A structured, 48-week curriculum to master Python, C, data structures, algorithms, and computer science fundamentals. 3 days per week, 144 days total, covering everything from basic programming to advanced systems topics.

## üéØ What You'll Learn

- **Python Track**: From basics to advanced topics (OOP, decorators, asyncio, performance optimization)
- **C/Systems Track**: Low-level programming, memory management, operating systems, networking
- **Design/Math Track**: Algorithm analysis, complexity theory, dynamic programming, graph algorithms

## üìö Structure

- **Week 1-12**: Foundations (Python basics, C intro, sorting, recursion, DP intro)
- **Week 13-24**: Intermediate (Trees, graphs, shortest paths, backtracking, tries)
- **Week 25-36**: Advanced (Segment trees, concurrency, network flow, string algorithms)
- **Week 37-48**: Mastery (Design patterns, kernel modules, system design, capstone project)

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A computer with Python 3.7+ installed
- 3-4 hours per day, 3 days per week
- Commitment to complete 48 weeks

### Generate the PDF Syllabus

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/programming-syllabus-48-weeks.git
cd programming-syllabus-48-weeks
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
