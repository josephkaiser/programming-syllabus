# 30-Week Programming Foundation

My personal syllabus for getting started learning Python, web development and algorithms.

Note: The syllabus PDF is created by the syllabus-generator.py file.

As I go through the course, I plan to update the repo to include solutions & project code.

## 1. Syllabus

Generate the complete syllabus PDF:

```bash
pip install reportlab
python syllabus_generator.py
```

## 2. Overview

- **Weeks 1-10**: Python fundamentals, debugging, OOP, testing, APIs
- **Weeks 11-18**: Web development (Flask), SQL, authentication, REST APIs
- **Weeks 19-24**: Terminal, Git, CI/CD, testing, deployment, performance
- **Weeks 25-30**: Algorithms, capstone project

**Schedule**: 4 days/week, 3-4 hours/day (~400-500 hours total)

## 3. Philosophy

Aims to provide an extended course-like syllabus that gives plenty of hands on practice spaced out appropriately for self-study. 

30 weeks chosen to give space for many of the most important topics relevant to real world software development today, while remaining manageable in length. A very quick study could accomplish the coursework in much less time.
